  <h1>Our History</h1>
  <p>
    Balo Backpacks was founded in 2022 by Sally Truong during her junior year of college. During a business class, Sally was tasked to come up with a product that would not only be helpful, but incorporated sustainability. The product? Balo Backpacks. After noticing there was a gap in the market for go-bags, Balo Backpacks was created to help prepare those in need for an emergency. What started out as a small scale company spiraled into a nationally recognized brand, and the company started creating different chains for their different consumer types. Today, Balo Backpacks cater to a wide market, from athletes and hikers to those in temperamental weather conditions.

  <h1>Why Use Us</h1>
  <p>
    Unlike other go-bag brands, Balo Backpacks source their backpacks from second-hand or donated sources, cutting down on the manufacturing of the bag. By doing so, the company hopes to lower the waste being emitted from those throwing away their used bags, as well as not contributing to the water pollution of the fashion and textile industry. In addition to the environmental impacts, the second-hand bags allow for a wider variety of styles and colors for the customer to choose from, and are often more stylish than the ones made from other companies. Balo Backpacks also have three different lines of go-bags, which allow for a more customized usage with each type.
